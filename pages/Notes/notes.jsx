/*
Explanation:

Define an array of Pokemon IDs: pokemonIds is an array that contains the IDs of the Pokemon you want to fetch.

Use state to manage the fetched Pokemon data: pokemonDataList is a state variable that will store the fetched data for each Pokemon.

Use the useEffect hook to fetch data when the component mounts: The useEffect hook is used to initiate the data fetching process when the component is mounted.

Define an asynchronous function to fetch data for each Pokemon ID: fetchDataForPokemon is an asynchronous function that will be responsible for fetching data for each Pokemon ID.

Use the map function to create an array of promises: dataPromises is an array of promises, where each promise corresponds to fetching data for a specific Pokemon ID.

Fetch data for each Pokemon ID using P.getPokemonByName: The map function is used to iterate over each Pokemon ID and fetch data using the P.getPokemonByName method.

Use Promise.all to wait for all promises to resolve: Promise.all is used to wait for all the promises in the dataPromises array to resolve. This ensures that all the data for the specified Pokemon IDs is fetched before proceeding.

Update the state with the fetched Pokemon data: Once all promises are resolved, the dataResults array contains the fetched data for each Pokemon. This data is then set to the state using setPokemonDataList.

Handle errors if any occur during the data fetching process: The try-catch block is used to catch any errors that might occur during the data fetching process.

Call the function to initiate the data fetching process: The fetchDataForPokemon function is called within the useEffect hook, triggering the data fetching process when the component mounts.

The dependency array ensures that the effect runs only when pokemonIds changes: The useEffect hook has a dependency array [pokemonIds], which means that the effect will run whenever the pokemonIds array changes.

Render loading state while data is being fetched: If the pokemonDataList is empty (indicating that data is still being fetched), a loading message is rendered.

Render paragraphs for each fetched Pokemon: Once the data is fetched, the component maps over the pokemonDataList array and renders a paragraph for each Pokemon, displaying the Pokemon's name.

Use the map function to iterate over the array of fetched Pokemon data: The map function is used to iterate over each element in the pokemonDataList array.

Access the 'name' property of each fetched data: For each Pokemon data object, the 'name' property is accessed and displayed within a paragraph tag.

This breakdown should help you understand how each part of the code contributes to fetching and displaying data for multiple Pok√©mon. */
